This is an Academic Project:

My chosen topic was HIV awareness, since in the making of this website, in Amsterdam, it was pride month for the LGTBQ+ community.
My goal with this project was to create a platform where people could come and get information about the virus, how the treatments work, and how you can keep a normal lifestyle, regardless of the HIV infection.
The structure I choose to tell this story is informative with the following pages: about hiv (home page), treatments, symptoms, frequently asked questions and get tested.
In the main page you can find the latest news about HIV, a newspaper subscription, if you want to stay informed and also links to the other pages of the website.
