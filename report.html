<!-- Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement? -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My chosen topic is HIV awareness, since in the making of this website, in Amsterdam, it was pride month for the LGTBQ+ community.
    <br> My goal with this project was to create a platform where people could come and get information about the virus, how the treatments work, and how you can keep a normal lifestyle, regardless of the HIV infection.
    <br> The structure I choose to tell this story is informative with the following pages: about hiv (home page), treatments, symptoms, frequently asked questions and get tested.
    <br> In the main page you can find the latest news about HIV, a newspaper subscription, if you want to stay informed and also links to the other pages of the website.
</p>
<!-- Inspiration: State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs). -->
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>My inspiration for this website comes from pride month and queer culture.
    <br> Hearing people talk about their illness, but, also how they live a normal life, despite of the stigma around HIV. As references, I had inspiration from Arik Hartmann, a speaker for “TED Talks”.
    <br> Then I started investigating more about HIV and how it is being represented, in websites.
    <br> So I found this website: “untransmittable.org”, which has a clear aesthetic, representing the transexual flag, in the theme color, I didn’t enjoy the layout, but I fancied the aesthetics in general and the idea behind it.
    <br> Thirdly, I searched in wikipedia, and other websites, for the information that I wanted to display, “wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV”.
    <br> The discrimination and missinformation in our current society and the impulse to discriminate against the “unknown”. I felt I could help create awareness about HIV and the stigma around it.

<!-- Accessibility: State 3 ways in which your site is accessible to those with different abilities and needs (for example those with visual impairment) -->
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>The website is accessible for people with vision issues, since it’s responsive, as well as fonts, images, etc. Therefore the elements in the web can be zoomed.
    <br> I have not used absolute positioning or px units, so that the webpage can adapt to an increased zoom above 100%.
    <br> Secondly, the project contains semantics to distinguish each section, image, paragraph, etc. Therefore it’s easy to understand when using a screen reader. Also, in each class that I have created, I have used the main class name repeatedly, so
    that whoever is analyzing it doesn’t get lost in the code.
    <br> Thirdy, I have declared the language to be English, so that it is accessible to anyone looking for an “english” website, or in a browser.
    <br> Fourthly, I have used a grid layout in each page, sharing the margin, making it responsive as well. Making sure everything looks cohesive and so that the user doesn't get lost with too much information.
    <br> Finally, I have used alternative text, I have applied “src” in each image, so that each of them have a title, in case it cannot be displayed for whatever reason.
</p>
<!-- Usability: State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site. -->
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>In web development, usability is said to be a product designed to be effective, efficient and satisfying.
    <br>To begin with, for the user experience, I designed the web to be fluid. In the main page for example, each section’s opacity changes as you scroll down, so that each section appears and you have time to analizy them.
    <br>Then, to guarantee the user experience, I have implemented a color palette that doesn’t use a digital “white”, rather I have used the same colors,
    <br>but in linear and circular gradients, so that it’s not just a solid, boring looking, color. The website gets entertaining by the way it looks, and how it presents itself.
    <br>Finally, since the site uses semantic tags, when the screen reader is reading it, it can easily explain the website to a person with vision disabilities.
    <br>It is a cohesive story, easy to understand, from the point of view of only hearing the web. About the information I explain in the website,
    <br>if the user is so interested and wishes to know more about the subject I have linked sources to find more information about the virus, testing places or symptoms.
</p>
<!-- Learning: state 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that? -->
<h3> Learning </h3>
<p>Firstly, to create the carousel of images, in the main page. I had to understand the design of it in css, and then the algorithm behind it in javascript.
    <br>Also, creating the arrows next to the images slides, made me realize the objects in the layout don’t necessarily need to follow the structure of the layout.
    <br>I went through many tutorials, in video, in articles and in the end I did a mix of everything, I didn’t follow just one tutorial, I had an idea of what I wanted for the carousel, and used parts of tutorials to achieve it.
    <br>Most of the tutorials would use absolute positioning, just images, or text, without animations, etc. In the end I created posters slides, in which you can find video,
    <br>images or text, but the posters contain the animation and layout already, so you only need to put your content inside the poster, and it works perfectly.
    <br>Secondly, I had to learn about layouts. From the course, I was using “template-areas”, for the layout, but, while creating the project I realized I work better,
    <br>with template-columns, and rows, and positioning them as it goes. For me it makes more sense while editing and to create changes without too much code editing.
    <br>Thirdly, from many things that I learned, managing svg, and images, setting them in a responsive way, with the correct height,
    <br>widths, color, opacity, etc. As well as applying color to svg images or playing with animations resizing it.
</p>
<!-- Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why? -->
<h3>Evaluation I</h3>
<p>I find the layout particularly successful, since I have used different structures per section but have the same right and left margins through the page.
    <br>It follows a main structure or layout, but each section has the number of columns that it needs.
    <br>Secondly, the use of images, and how I positioned them, so that the responsiveness of the site is fluid and not changing at every breakpoint.
    <br>Thirdly, talking about responsiveness, for the font size of each element I used the function “clamp” which makes the site even more fluid,
    <br>allowing the font to increase or decrease depending on the size of the screen or window.
    <br>In this final project, I have learned a lot about responsiveness and how to design a fluid structure in a website.
</p>
<!-- Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time? -->
<h3>Evaluation II</h3>
<p>The aspects of my work that I could have improved is spending more time working on the overall aesthetic of the site,
    <br>although the appearance is quite good, I think that if I had had more time to edit it, it would be even more fluid.
    <br>Also working with responsiveness, I could have displayed the elements better, now it's functional and overall easy to read, I have this feeling that it could be better.
    <br>For future projects I will spend more time on the mock up of the pages, as well as the wireframes.
    <br>Because editing directly from code, made me lose time, and not using a software like figma to edit the appearance and then once I know how it has to look then start coding, once I realized that, I started working on Figma and then to code.
    <br>In general, I felt it was a learning experience, were I was wrong to be so stubborn in the beginning, but after the frustation, I opened my mind to a more visual and choose an easier solution, like Figma.

<h3>Resources: What resources did you use in your work? List any sources of information, libraries, plugins, code or tools (you should also indicate inclusions from other sources within your code using comments)</h3>
<p>For wireframes, mock-ups and graphics in general, I used Figma, plugins like mockup. I found it easy to use, especially for the overall aesthetic.
    <br>For fonts, I used google-fonts which is a library that allows you to use an incredible amount of fonts with 2 lines of code.
    <br>For the images, I used google images, and used the ones that had high quality. For the svg’s I used “svgsilh” web, where you can search for any kind of svg, you can also edit it.
